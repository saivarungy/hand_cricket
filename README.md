# Hand Cricket Game 

It's a fascinating game to play hand cricket. When you are bored and lack the necessary equipment to engage in any advanced sport, it is better. It just needs two players, and they follow some predetermined rules as they play the game. Choosing odd and even is the first step in the game. Next, there is a toss, and the winner gets to choose between bowling and batting.

Although in a completely different fashion, hand cricket does incorporate the game of cricket. It's more like paper and scissors in this game. Scores are represented by fingers and movement. A person uses his hand to throw scissors in order to score one run. For a score of four, one must add his index finger to the number three. For a whopping six, one must clench their fist and extend their thumb.

Despite how straightforward the game is, it has a very long potential playing time. But it also includes guidelines for wickets. When a player loses his wicket, he is declared out and the game ends for him at that precise score. When both parties wave the same sign, one person exits. If you win the toss and choose to bat but both you and the opposing player make the same sign, the game is finished. The following player then has the chance to play and surpass your score. It's the way that this thrilling game is played.
